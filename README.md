# Item Manager
It's just a slightly more user-friendly way to manage a single .json file containing **every** item in a game.

# Features
- Add .json files to the item_templates folder to define the default keys/values for new items.
- Multiple template files can be added to the templates folder, which will all appear in the Items drop down menu.
- Uses the "unique_id" key to sort/search items, and will not allow items with duplicate unique_id's. 
- Add new keys to items by updating the template file and using File > Sync Templates to add missing keys to all items created from each template.
- Uses the search bar to easily search through all items in the database.
